# Helper functions for inferring a network from a data file

"""
    get_nodes(data_file_path::String; <keyword arguments>)

Gets an array of all Nodes from a data file. It is assumed that the first
line of the file is headers (which are discarded) and the subsequent lines
each represent one node, and are of the form:

Label    data_value1  data_value2 ...

though a different delimiter may be specified.

Arguments:
* `data_file_path`: path to the data file
* `delim=false`: the file's delimiter. Leave as false if it is whitespace
* `discretizer="bayesian_blocks"`: algorithm for discretizing the data
* `estimator="maximum_likelihood"`: algorithm for estimating probabilities
* `number_of_bins=10`: will be overwritten if using "bayesian_blocks"

The "maximum_likelihood" estimator is recommended for PUC and PIDC.

Writes a network file from an InferredNetwork type. Each line of the file

will be written in both directions with the same weight:
